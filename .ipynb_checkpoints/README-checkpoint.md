# **SEA MACHINES**

## Overview and Origin

Sea Machines was founded in 2015 by Michael Gordon Johnson with the goal of introducing autonomus autonomous vehicular technology to the field of marine navigation. In a 2015 interview with Maritime Reporter, Johnson explained his inspiration:
> “The idea was conceived like a puzzle over the last five years, piece by piece as I managed and executed various marine projects,” said Johnson. “Once the concept came together, I quickly realized that this is the future of marine operations and the 20-year transition towards full adoption of
unmanned vessels for certain markets is just about to commence.”

Original headquartered in Boston, Sea Machines has since expanded to additional offices in Hamburg, Germany and Esbjerg, Denmark
